# Customer Segmentation

A machine learning project that segments mall customers using K-Means clustering based on their annual income and spending behavior. This project analyzes customer data to identify distinct spending patterns and create customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

## Features
- CustomerID, Gender, Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)
  
## Results & Key Takeaways
Customer segments identified:
  1. Premium Customers (High Income, High Spending):
     - Target demographic for luxury products and premium services
     - Highest profit potential per customer
       
  2. Potential Customers (High Income, Low Spending):
     - Opportunity for conversion through targeted marketing
     - Focus on demonstrating value and quality
       
  3. Loyal Customers (Medium Income, Medium Spending):
     - Stable customer base for consistent revenue
     - Good candidates for loyalty programs and referrals
     
  4. Impulsive Buyers (Low Income, High Spending):

     - Target with affordable, trendy items and promotions
     
  5. Budget Shoppers (Low Income, Low Spending):
